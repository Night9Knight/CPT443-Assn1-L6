and three federal territories and has a total landmass of 329,847 <strong>square</strong> kilometres (127,350 sq mi)
separated <strong>by</strong> the <strong>South</strong> China Sea into two <strong>similarly</strong> sized regions, Peninsular Malaysia and <strong>East</strong>
Malaysia (Malaysian Borneo). Peninsular Malaysia shares a land and maritime border with Thailand
and maritime borders with Singapore, Vietnam, and Indonesia. <strong>East</strong> Malaysia shares land and
maritime borders with Brunei and Indonesia and a maritime border with the Philippines. The capital
city is Kuala Lumpur, while Putrajaya is the seat of the federal government. <strong>By</strong> 2015, with a population
of <strong>over</strong> 30 million, Malaysia became 43rd <strong>most</strong> populous country <strong>in</strong> the world. The southernmost
point of continental Eurasia, Tanjung Piai, is <strong>in</strong> Malaysia, located <strong>in</strong> the tropics. It is one of 17

Malaysia has its origins <strong>in</strong> the Malay kingdoms present <strong>in</strong> the area which, from the 18th century,
became subject to the British Empire. The <strong>first</strong> British territories were known <strong>as</strong> the Straits
Settlements, whose establishment was followed <strong>by</strong> the Malay kingdoms becoming British
protectorates. The territories <strong>on</strong> Peninsular Malaysia were <strong>first</strong> unified <strong>as</strong> the Malayan Union <strong>in</strong> 1946.
Malaya was restructured <strong>as</strong> the Federation of Malaya <strong>in</strong> 1948, and achieved independence <strong>on</strong> 31
August 1957. Malaya united with <strong>North</strong> Borneo, Sarawak, and Singapore <strong>on</strong> 16 September 1963, with
is being added to give the <strong>new</strong> country the name Malaysia. <strong>Less</strong> than two years <strong>later</strong> <strong>in</strong> 1965,
Singapore was expelled from the federation.

Since its independence, Malaysia has had one of the <strong>best</strong> economic records <strong>in</strong> Asia, with its GDP
growing at an average of 6.5% <strong>per_annum</strong> for <strong>almost</strong> 50 years. The economy has <strong>traditionally</strong> been
fuelled <strong>by</strong> its natural resources, <strong>but</strong> is expanding <strong>in</strong> the sectors of science, tourism, commerce and
medical tourism. <strong>Today</strong>, Malaysia has a <strong>newly</strong> industrialised market economy, ranked <strong>third</strong> largest <strong>in</strong>
<strong>Southeast</strong> Asia and 29th largest <strong>in</strong> the world. It is a founding member of the Association of <strong>Southeast</strong>
Asian Nations, the <strong>East</strong> Asia Summit and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and a member of
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Commonwealth of Nations, and the Non-Aligned Movement.
